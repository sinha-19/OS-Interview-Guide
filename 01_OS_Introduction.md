## What is an Operating System (OS)?

- An **Operating System** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
- Acts as an interface between users and computer hardware.

## Functions of OS

- **Process Management:** Creating, scheduling, terminating processes.
- **Memory Management:** Allocating/deallocating memory space.
- **File System Management:** Organizing, storing, retrieving files.
- **Device Management:** Controlling peripheral devices via drivers.
- **Security & Protection:** Controlling access, ensuring security.
- **User Interface:** CLI (Command-Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch OS:** No direct interaction. Jobs are collected and processed in batches.
- **Multiprogramming OS:** Multiple programs loaded in memory, CPU switches between them.
- **Multitasking OS:** Multiple tasks at the same time (foreground/background).
- **Time-Sharing OS:** Each user gets a time slice; quick switching.
- **Real-Time OS:** Strict timing constraints for critical tasks (robots, aircraft).
- **Distributed OS:** Manages a group of independent computers as a single system.
- **Embedded OS:** Specialized for embedded systems (IoT, cars, appliances).
